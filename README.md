# Frontend app + BaaS (Firebase)

Hosted on Vercel, you can visit [here](https://marvelous-cars.vercel.app/)

### About app

Full CRUD app where you can create, read, update and delete your car model, brand and give it a price.

### I used:

- Vite - build tool
- Typescript
- Tailwind for CSS
- MobX - state manager
- BaaS - Firebase(database + backend)
- JS classes for ApiServices

### Try it out

App is live and hosted on Vercel and link is on top of Readme file. If you want code on your local machine, you can use "git clone" + "npm i" + "npm run dev".

BUT you will need your own backend and database and you'll need to update your .env variables. Feel free to ask me for help if needed, contact on the bottom of Readme file.
